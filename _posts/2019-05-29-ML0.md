### Exercise  

>1.$X, Y$ are random variables , $P$ is the probability distribution.  Write the relation between 1$P(X), P(X,Y), P(Y \| X)$  

>2.$X, Y$ are discrete random variables,$Y \in [y_1,\cdots, y_n],$ $P$ is the probability. Write the relation between$P(X), P(X,Y)$  

>3.$X$ is real-valued continuous random variable, $p(x)$ is the probability density of $X = x$, Write the probability of $x\in(a, b)$ and $x\in(-\infty, +\infty)$  

>4.$X$ is real-valued continuous random variable, $p(x)$ is the probability density of $X = x$, Write $E(x)$(the expectation of $x$) and $var(x)$(The variance of $x$)
